Hi! I'm Kat, a software engineer based in New York City. You've stumbled upon my blog where I muse on all things Javascript and web development related. 

What am I doing when I'm not coding and drinking obscene amounts of coffee? I'm probably at improv class, or trying out the latest Gordon Ramsay recipe (with varying success), or traveling to an exciting location (18 countries and counting).
